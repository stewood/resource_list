## üéØ MVP Acceptance Criteria Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Creating a Draft without `name` fails with clear error

- [ ] Attempting to UPDATE/DELETE a `resource_version` or `audit_log` row fails via triggers
- [ ] FTS search returns expected results for common queries
- [ ] CSV import creates Drafts for valid rows and produces error report for invalid rows
- [ ] App runs in Docker; DB is created/used at `/data/db.sqlite3` on mounted volume

### User Experience
- [ ] Users can easily navigate between resources
- [ ] Status transitions are clear and validated
- [ ] Search and filtering work intuitively
- [ ] Forms provide helpful validation feedback
- [ ] Dashboard shows key information at a glance

## üîÑ How to Update This TODO

1. **Mark tasks as complete**: Change `[ ]` to `[x]`
2. **Update priorities**: Adjust Priority levels as needed
3. **Add new tasks**: Insert new items in appropriate sections
4. **Update progress**: Recalculate completion percentages
5. **Add notes**: Use comments for additional context

## üìû Next Actions

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Set up user authentication and roles
2. Create basic resource list and form views
3. Implement FTS5 search functionality
4. Add CSV import/export capabilities

**Questions to Resolve:**
- Should we implement the API in MVP or post-MVP?
- What level of test coverage is required for MVP?
- Are there any specific UI/UX requirements beyond the spec?
