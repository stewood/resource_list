# AI Resource Verification and Update Process

This document provides a complete step-by-step process for AI assistants to verify and update resource records in the Homeless Resource Directory.

## üéØ Overview

This process follows a 3-step workflow:
1. **Identify** a draft resource to update
2. **Research** the organization to find verified information
3. **Update** the resource with verified data and move to "needs_review" status

## üìã Step 1: Identify a Draft Resource

### Command to Find a Resource
```bash
cd /home/stewood/rl/cli_review
python auto_update_random.py --show-only
```

### What to Look For
- **Missing Information**: Resources with incomplete contact details, addresses, or descriptions
- **Outdated Information**: Resources that may have changed contact information
- **Incomplete Data**: Resources missing essential fields like phone, website, or location
- **Poor Quality**: Resources with minimal descriptions or unclear service information

### Priority Indicators
- ‚ùå Missing phone number
- ‚ùå Missing website
- ‚ùå Missing city/state
- ‚ùå Missing or poor description
- ‚ùå Missing service types
- ‚ùå Missing hours of operation

## üîç Step 2: Research Guidelines

### Search Strategy

#### 1. **Primary Search Sources**
- **Official Website**: Always start with the organization's official website
- **Google Search**: Use organization name + location + "contact"
- **Government Databases**: For government agencies and official services
- **Social Media**: Check Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn for current information

#### 2. **Proven Research Techniques** (Based on Field Experience)
- **Start with exact phone number search**: "[Phone Number] [Organization Name] Kentucky" often yields the most relevant results
- **Use specific search terms**: Add "phone address hours" to get contact information quickly
- **Cross-reference multiple sources**: Always verify information from at least 2-3 sources
- **Check for recent updates**: Look for information updated within the last 2 years
- **Use browser bookmarks**: Save frequently visited sites like NCES for schools, government databases
- **Batch similar organizations**: Develop templates for common types (schools, churches, government agencies)

#### 3. **Search Queries to Use**
```
"[Organization Name] [City, State] phone address hours"
"[Organization Name] contact information"
"[Organization Name] official website"
"[Organization Name] services hours of operation"
"[Organization Name] eligibility requirements"
"[Phone Number] [Organization Name] Kentucky"  # Most effective for verification
```

#### 4. **Information to Verify**
- **Contact Information**: Phone, email, website
- **Location**: Full address, city, state, zip code
- **Hours**: Days and times of operation
- **Services**: What they actually provide
- **Eligibility**: Who can use their services
- **Cost**: Free, sliding scale, insurance accepted
- **Languages**: Languages spoken/available

#### 5. **Common Data Quality Issues Found** (Based on Field Experience)
- **Phone number formatting**: Many resources have unformatted numbers (e.g., "6068624639" vs "(606) 862-4639")
- **Missing city/state information**: Several resources lack basic location data
- **Outdated information**: Some phone numbers or addresses are no longer valid
- **Generic descriptions**: Many resources have minimal descriptions that need enhancement
- **Missing website URLs**: Official websites often exist but aren't listed

### Verification Rules

#### ‚úÖ **Must Verify**
- **Phone Numbers**: Call or verify on official website
- **Addresses**: Check against official website or Google Maps
- **Hours**: Confirm current operating hours
- **Services**: Verify what services are actually provided
- **Website URLs**: Ensure they work and are current

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cross-Reference**
- **Multiple Sources**: Check at least 2-3 sources for consistency
- **Government Sources**: Prefer official government websites
- **Recent Information**: Look for information updated within the last 2 years
- **Local Sources**: Prefer local/state sources over national ones

#### ‚ùå **Avoid**
- **Outdated Information**: Information older than 2 years
- **Third-Party Listings**: Unless they're official government databases
- **Unverified Claims**: Information that can't be confirmed
- **Personal Opinions**: Stick to factual information only

#### üìä **Efficiency Metrics** (Based on Field Experience)
- **Average time per resource**: 5-10 minutes for most resources
- **Success rate**: ~90% of resources are successfully verifiable
- **Most time-consuming**: Resources with outdated information or multiple similar organizations
- **Quick wins**: Schools, government agencies, and well-established nonprofits
