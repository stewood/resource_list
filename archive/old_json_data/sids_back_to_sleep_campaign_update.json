  "description": "The Safe to Sleep® campaign (formerly known as the Back to Sleep campaign) is a national public education campaign led by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to help reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and other sleep-related infant deaths. The campaign educates parents, caregivers, healthcare providers, and others about evidence-based ways to reduce the risk of SIDS, including placing babies on their backs to sleep, using a firm sleep surface, room sharing without bed sharing, and avoiding soft bedding and overheating. The campaign provides free educational materials, resources, and training for healthcare providers and families.",
