# GIS Development Scripts - Archived

This directory contains temporary development scripts that were used during the GIS caching implementation but are not needed for ongoing operations.

## Archived Files

### `check_duplicates.py`
- **Purpose**: Script to check for duplicates in the CoverageArea database table
- **Created**: During GIS caching implementation
- **Status**: Development tool - no longer needed
- **Functionality**: 
  - Checked for duplicate names across states
  - Checked for duplicate FIPS codes
  - Checked for duplicate ext_ids combinations
  - Provided summary statistics

### `investigate_duplicates.py`
- **Purpose**: Script to investigate same-state duplicates in detail
- **Created**: During GIS caching implementation  
- **Status**: Development tool - no longer needed
- **Functionality**:
  - Investigated 38 same-state duplicates
  - Determined all were legitimate (different FIPS codes)
  - Confirmed no actual duplicates existed

## Why These Files Are Archived

These scripts were created as **development and verification tools** during the GIS caching implementation process. They served their purpose by:

1. **Verifying data integrity** after the import process
2. **Confirming no duplicates** were created during the import
3. **Investigating potential issues** that turned out to be legitimate geographic naming

## Current Status

- ✅ **No actual duplicates found** in the database
- ✅ **All "duplicates" are legitimate** (same names in different states/counties)
- ✅ **Database integrity confirmed** - 7,827 records imported successfully
- ✅ **GIS caching system working perfectly**

## Essential Files (Not Archived)

The following files remain in the main project as they are essential for ongoing operations:

- `scripts/geo_manager.py` - Main GIS management CLI
- `scripts/cache_manager.py` - Cache management CLI  
- `docs/GIS_CACHING_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation
- `directory/utils/tiger_cache.py` - Core caching utility
- `directory/management/commands/import_*.py` - Django management commands

## Archive Date
- **Archived**: August 29, 2025
- **Reason**: Development tools no longer needed after successful implementation
- **Status**: Available for reference if needed in future development
