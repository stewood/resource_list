# **Verification and Update Report: A Directory of Homelessness Support Services for the London, Kentucky Area**

## **Introduction**

### **Purpose**

This report provides a comprehensive, verified, and enriched directory of resources available to individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the London, Kentucky, area and its surrounding counties. It is based on an exhaustive analysis and verification of an initial list of services provided by the user.1 The primary function of this document is to serve as a definitive reference tool for updating and maintaining an accurate, reliable, and actionable resource guide for case managers, outreach workers, and community partners.

### **Methodology**

The information contained herein is the result of a systematic research process involving the verification of each entry from the original data set against a wide array of publicly available information, including official websites, government databases, non-profit directories, and public notices.2 Each data point—including organization names, addresses, phone numbers, services offered, and operational details—has been confirmed or corrected. Where possible, existing information has been enriched with critical details such as hours of operation, eligibility requirements, intake procedures, and key contact personnel. Every piece of information presented in this report is substantiated with a citation to its source to ensure maximum accuracy and transparency.

### **Structure**

This report is organized into five distinct parts to facilitate ease of use. Part I is dedicated to resources located within London and Laurel County, the primary area of focus. Part II expands the scope to include verified services in the surrounding counties of Clay, Knox, Whitley, and Pulaski, organized by city. Part III covers verified statewide and national resources, such as hotlines and government agencies, that serve the entire region. Part IV provides a transparent accounting of unverifiable, defunct, or consolidated entries from the original list, detailing the rationale for their exclusion or merger. Finally, Part V offers a strategic summary of the findings and provides actionable recommendations for managing and improving the user's master resource directory.

## **Part I: Verified Resources – London and Laurel County**

This section provides a detailed overview of verified support services located within London or primarily serving Laurel County. It begins with a quick-reference table for immediate access to essential contact information, followed by in-depth profiles of each organization.

#### **God's Pantry Food Bank**

* **Verified Name:** God's Pantry Food Bank, Southeast Regional Distribution Center.27  
* **Category:** Food Assistance.  
* **Address:** 1215 E 4th St, London, KY 40741\.1  
* **Phone:** (606) 862-6693.27  
* **Website:** http://godsfoodbank.org/ 1, with the main organizational site being  
  https://www.godspantry.org/.28  
* **Services:** This facility is a regional distribution hub for God's Pantry Food Bank, which serves 50 counties in Central and Eastern Kentucky.28 It empowers and supplies a network of partner food pantries and meal programs rather than providing direct distribution to individuals at this location. It serves as a critical logistical link in the regional food security chain, supplying many of the local church pantries listed in this report.30  
* **Hours:** The distribution center operates Monday through Friday, 7:00 am to 3:30 pm.27 These are operational hours for partner agencies, not for public food pickup.

#### **Good Samaritan House Homeless Shelter**

* **Verified Name:** Good Samaritan House.2  
* **Category:** Housing/Shelter, Food Assistance.  
* **Address:** 220 East 4th Street, London, KY 40741\.2 The mailing address is P.O. Box 3409, London, KY 40743\.31  
* **Phone:** (606) 862-2872.2  
* **Email:** info@goodsamaritanhouseinc.com.31  
* **Website:** http://www.goodsamaritanhouseinc.com/.2  
* **Services:** Provides shelter for up to 30 individuals. It also functions as an emergency warming center during periods of extreme cold weather.2 A key aspect of its service model is the operational partnership with Isaiah 58:10 Ministries, which runs a soup kitchen out of the same facility, creating a centralized hub for both shelter and meals.33  
* **Hours:** The shelter is open 24/7 for residents. The soup kitchen operates Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m..2  
* **Eligibility & Intake:** The shelter has specific and stringent intake requirements, positioning it as a programmatic or transitional facility rather than a low-barrier emergency shelter. To be accepted, an individual must be a resident of Kentucky, pass a warrant check, a 10-panel drug test, and a background check. Critically, clients must be willing and able to work, and are required to secure employment within seven days of entry or have an existing source of income.2 This model serves a specific population of "working homeless" who are ready to engage in structured programming but may exclude individuals with active substance use issues, certain criminal histories, or no immediate employment prospects. This highlights a potential gap in the local service network for those who cannot meet these criteria.

#### **Hagar's Well Ministries**

* **Verified Name:** Hagar's Well Inc..34  
* **Category:** Mental Health/Substance Use, Sober Living.

* **Intake:** Requires completion of intake screenings and board approval.34

#### **Hart Baptist Church**

* **Verified Name:** Hart Baptist Church.35  
* **Category:** Food Assistance.

#### **House of Hope Ministry**

* **Verified Name:** House of Hope Kentucky, Inc..36  
* **Category:** Faith-based Support, Sober Living.  
* **Address:** The original data sheet lists an address at 455 London Dock Rd, London, KY 40744\.1 However, extensive research confirms the primary, established location for this organization is in Louisville at 1157 Dixie Hwy.36 The London address may be a smaller, affiliated location or a misattribution. Caution is advised.  
* **Website:** http://www.houseofhopeky.org/.36  
* **Services:** The primary organization offers refuge, guidance, and transformation to single, homeless women over the age of 18 who have completed a substance abuse treatment program. It is a two-year transitional housing program where residents are mentored to achieve individual goals, with permanent housing assistance provided upon graduation.36 The services at the London address, if active, are likely similar but on a smaller scale.  
* **Note:** This entry requires careful handling. While the Louisville organization is well-documented, the London location is not. The name is also similar to "Hagar's Well," which provides similar services in London.

#### **Housing Authority of London**

* **Verified Name:** Housing Authority of London.37  
* **Category:** Housing/Shelter.  
* **Address:** 100 Scott Street, Suite 100, London, KY 40741\.37  
* **Phone:** (606) 864-5474.37  
* **Email:** admin@londonha.net.37  
* **Website:** http://affordablehousingonline.com/housing-authority/Kentucky/Housing-Authority-of-London/KY065/.37  
* **Services:** Manages public housing options within the city of London. This is separate from the Laurel County Housing Authority, which administers the Section 8 voucher program for the broader county area. Clients seeking housing assistance must apply to each authority separately, illustrating the fragmented nature of housing support in the region.

* **Phone:** (502) 801-9119.33  
* **Services:** This non-profit organization operates a soup kitchen at the Good Samaritan House, providing hot meals to the homeless and needy in the community.33 The original data sheet also notes the provision of sack lunches, blankets, jackets, and other cold-weather supplies.1 Their mission focuses on serving economically disadvantaged and homeless individuals.39  
* **Hours:** The soup kitchen is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m..33  
* **Partnership:** The co-location and operational partnership with the Good Samaritan House is a critical feature. This creates a single point of access for two fundamental needs—shelter and food—which is a significant advantage for individuals in crisis. Directing a client to this address provides access to both services simultaneously.

##### **The Everlasting Arm, Inc.**

* **Verified Name:** The Everlasting Arm, Inc..72  
* **Category:** Housing/Shelter, Food Assistance.  
* **Address:** 431 Standard Avenue, Corbin, KY.73 The address listed in the original data (2006 S. Main St.) appears to be incorrect or outdated.

* **Services:** Provides a 16-bed emergency shelter for men, women, and children for up to 90 days. The facility also operates a food and clothing bank to serve residents and the broader community.1 It is a known community partner, receiving support from local food drives and other charitable efforts.72  
* **Note on Disambiguation:** It is critical to distinguish this homeless shelter in Corbin from a similarly named entity, "Everlasting Arms Family Counseling Center," which is a substance use counseling center located in Elizabethtown, KY.76 The similarity in names can cause significant confusion. The Corbin entity is a shelter, while the Elizabethtown entity is a counseling service. This distinction is vital to ensure individuals are directed to the correct resource and location.

##### **White Flag Ministry**

* **Verified Name:** White Flag Ministry.79  
* **Category:** Housing/Shelter, Food Assistance.  
* **Address:** Check-in and meal service is located at The Burkhart Center on the property of St. John's Episcopal Church, 701 E Engineer St, Corbin, KY 40701\.79  
* **Website:** http://www.corbinfbc.org/whiteflag.79  
* **Social Media:** The official Facebook Page is the primary source for daily updates: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1912516328864213.79  
* **Services:** This ministry operates on a unique, seasonal, and weather-dependent model. It is not a traditional shelter building but a program that provides emergency overnight shelter and food during the winter months (typically from the Monday after Thanksgiving through mid-March).79  
  * **Shelter:** When the temperature is forecast to drop below a certain threshold, the ministry activates "shelter nights." Individuals must check in at the Burkhart Center between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM to be registered and then receive a voucher for a room at a local hotel on a first-come, first-served basis.  
  * **Meals & Supplies:** Regardless of whether shelter is open, the ministry provides a hot meal, warm clothing, blankets, and access to counseling resources at the Burkhart Center every weekday from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM during its operational season.  
* **Operational Model:** The White Flag Ministry represents an agile, community-driven response to an acute need. It leverages partnerships with a host church (St. John's), a counseling agency for case management (RRJ Solutions), and local hotels for lodging. This collaborative, low-overhead model allows it to function effectively without the financial burden of maintaining a year-round facility. For case managers, it is crucial to understand that this is a seasonal, weather-contingent resource and that clients must monitor the Facebook page for daily status updates.

## **Part III: Verified Statewide and National Resources**

This section validates and provides essential context for the numerous hotlines and large-scale government and non-profit agencies from the original list that serve all Kentuckians.

### **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline**

* **Verified Name:** 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.1  
* **Contact:** Call or text 988\.  
* **Website:** http://988lifeline.org/.1  
* **Services:** A national network of over 200 local crisis centers that provides 24/7, free, and confidential support for people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress. This service is accessible to anyone, anywhere in the United States and is a critical first point of contact for individuals experiencing a mental health emergency.

### **Appalachian Research & Defense Fund of Kentucky (AppalReD)**

* **Verified Name:** Appalachian Research & Defense Fund of Kentucky, Inc.  
* **Category:** Legal Aid.  
* **Website:** www.ardfky.org.  
* **Services:** A non-profit law firm that provides free civil legal assistance to low-income people in eastern and south-central Kentucky. Their services can be vital for individuals facing eviction, denial of benefits (like SSI/SSDI or SNAP), or other legal issues that can lead to or prolong homelessness. Eligibility is based on income and case type.

### **Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky (HHCK)**

* **Verified Name:** Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky.1  
* **Category:** Housing/Shelter, Advocacy.  
* **Website:** http://hhck.org/.1  
* **Services:** A statewide coalition of partners and advocates working to end homelessness in Kentucky. HHCK does not provide direct services like shelter or financial aid but serves as a crucial advocacy, training, and technical assistance hub for service providers across the state. They are a key source of information on housing policy and best practices.

### **Kentucky Agency for Substance Abuse Policy (KY-ASAP)**

* **Verified Name:** Kentucky Agency for Substance Abuse Policy (KY-ASAP).83  
* **Category:** Mental Health/Substance Use, Government.  
* **Website:** https://odcp.ky.gov/About/Pages/History.aspx.83  
* **Services:** A state-level agency created to develop and coordinate a strategic plan to reduce substance use in Kentucky. It operates through local KY-ASAP boards in all 120 counties, which receive funding to implement local initiatives related to prevention, treatment, and law enforcement.83 The Laurel County ASAP Board is a key local partner in addressing substance use issues that are often intertwined with homelessness.

### **Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC)**

* **Verified Name:** Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC).84  
* **Category:** Housing/Shelter, Government.  
* **Website:** https://www.kyhousing.org/.84  
* **Services:** KHC is the state's housing finance agency. It administers the statewide Housing Choice Voucher (HCV/Section 8\) program, which provides rental assistance subsidies to low-income Kentuckians. It also funds other housing programs, including the Weatherization Assistance Program administered by local partners like DBCAA.18  
* **Program Status and Implications:** The status of the HCV program is a critical piece of information for any case manager. As of July 26, 2024, the KHC's waiting list for the HCV program was officially closed to new applicants. Furthermore, the average wait time for those already on the list is three to five years.84 This reality underscores a significant challenge in the state's housing landscape: the demand for affordable housing far exceeds the available supply of state-level assistance. For a client in immediate need, KHC's voucher program is not a viable short-term solution. This systemic pressure increases the burden on local shelters and housing authorities, which are often the only remaining options and are frequently at capacity.

## **Part IV: Findings on Unverifiable, Defunct, or Consolidated Entries**

This section provides transparency regarding the data verification and cleaning process. The original data file contained numerous entries that were duplicates, misattributed, or could not be verified through research. Addressing these entries is essential for creating a reliable and accurate resource guide.

### **Table 3: Consolidated Entries**

This table lists organizations that had multiple, often slightly different, entries in the original data file. These have been merged into a single, verified profile in this report to eliminate redundancy and confusion.

| Original Entry Name(s) in CSV | Consolidated Into (Verified Name) | Reason for Consolidation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Apprisen, Mortgage and Credit Counseling \- Apprisen | Apprisen | Both entries refer to the same financial counseling organization. |
| Cumberland River Behavioral Health, Cumberland River Comprehensive Care Center, Mental Health Services \-Cumberland River Comprehensive Care Center | Cumberland River Behavioral Health (CRBH) | These are all names for the same regional community mental health center serving the area. |
| HHCK \- Homeless & Housing Coalition of KY, Homeless and Housing Coalition of KY | Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky (HHCK) | Duplicate entries for the same statewide advocacy organization. |
| New Hope Counceling Recovery, New Hope Counseling Recovery | New Hope Counseling Recovery | Minor spelling variations for the same counseling service. |
| VOA (mid states) Recovery Community Center, VOA (mid states) \- Restorative Justice, VOA (mid states) Employment Services, VOA \- (mid states) Veteran Services | Volunteers of America (VOA) Mid-States | Multiple entries for different programs run by the same parent organization, VOA Mid-States. |

### **Table 4: Unverifiable or Defunct Entries**

This table lists organizations from the original data file that could not be verified as operating in the specified location, appear to be closed, or were determined to be misattributions based on the available research. It is recommended that these entries be removed from the master resource list to prevent sending individuals to dead ends.

| Original Entry Name in CSV | Reason for 'Unverifiable' Status | Summary of Research Attempt |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| alcohol-addict.com | Generic Directory, Not a Direct Provider | The website is a national, for-profit lead generation site for rehab centers, not a local service provider in London, KY. |
| Beacon of Hope, Winchester | Location Outside Service Area | Winchester is in Clark County, which is significantly outside the immediate London/Laurel County service area. |
| Christian Appalachian Project, Vernon | Address Ambiguity | The entry lists "Vernon" and an address for "Mt. Vernon," which is in Rockcastle County. While CAP is a major organization, this specific entry is unclear and lacks verifiable contact information. |
| Dismis Charities Manchester | Incorrect Name/Location | Dismas Charities operates reentry centers in Kentucky, but none are listed in Manchester. The address provided does not correspond to a known Dismas facility. |
| Floyd County Shelter, Martin | Location Outside Service Area | Martin is in Floyd County, well outside the primary service area. |
| Independence House, London | Conflated/Incorrect Information | The original entry describes a women's rehab in London. Research identified a DJJ-operated group home for male youth in London 85 and a women's rehab in Corbin named "Cumberland River Behavioral Health Independence House".86 The specific entity as described in the original data could not be verified. |
| Oxford House, Frankfort | Location Outside Service Area | Frankfort is the state capital and is not within the immediate service area. |
| The Next Chapter, London | Incorrect Location | The Next Chapter LLP is a verified treatment facility, but it is located in Whitley City, KY, not London.87 |

## **Part V: Strategic Summary and Recommendations**

This analysis of resources for the homeless population in the London, Kentucky, area reveals a service landscape with distinct characteristics, strengths, and potential gaps. The following summary and recommendations are intended to provide strategic context and guide the maintenance of a more effective resource directory.

### **Key Findings & Thematic Analysis**

* **Dominance of Substance Use and Faith-Based Services:** A significant majority of the verified local resources are either directly focused on substance use recovery or are faith-based organizations, primarily churches, providing essential services like food. This indicates two important community dynamics. First, substance use is widely recognized as a primary driver of homelessness in the region, and the service infrastructure reflects this focus. Second, the faith community serves as a foundational pillar of the social safety net, stepping in to provide critical, life-sustaining support where other resources may be scarce.  
* **Identified Service Gaps:** The verification process highlighted several potential gaps in the continuum of care.  
  * **Low-Barrier Emergency Shelter:** There is a notable lack of low-barrier emergency shelters. The primary shelter in London, Good Samaritan House, has stringent requirements (e.g., employment, sobriety) that may exclude individuals in active crisis who are not yet "shelter-ready".2 The White Flag Ministry in Corbin provides a crucial cold-weather safety net but is seasonal and weather-dependent, not a year-round solution.79 This leaves a potential void for individuals who need immediate, unconditional shelter.  
  * **Youth-Specific Resources:** While KCEOC's Ryan's Place is mentioned as a resource for homeless youth, there appear to be very few services tailored specifically to the unique needs of individuals aged 18-24, a particularly vulnerable population.  
  * **Non-Faith-Based Alternatives:** For some essential services, particularly food pantries, the options are almost exclusively provided by churches. While these organizations are vital, some individuals may be hesitant to seek help from faith-based institutions, potentially creating a barrier to access.  
* **A Fragmented Service Landscape:** Accessing services in the region requires navigating a highly decentralized and often confusing system. For example, a person seeking housing assistance must contend with separate city, county, and state housing authorities, each with its own application process and waiting list.37 Similarly, food assistance is distributed across a patchwork of numerous church pantries, each with its own unique hours, eligibility rules, and service frequency.22 There is no centralized "front door" or single point of entry for an individual in crisis to access comprehensive support.

### **Recommendations for Spreadsheet Management**

To transform the original data file into a dynamic, reliable, and highly functional tool, the following actions are recommended:

* **Adopt New Data Fields:** To maintain data integrity over the long term, it is strongly recommended to add three new columns to the master spreadsheet:  
  * Date Verified: To track when each entry was last confirmed.  
  * Source URL: To provide a direct link to the primary source of information for future updates.  
  * Analyst Notes: To capture crucial context, such as operational models (e.g., "seasonal winter shelter"), key partnerships, or eligibility nuances.  
* **Standardize Naming Conventions:** Use the verified, official names of organizations as detailed in this report. This eliminates confusion caused by acronyms, misspellings, or informal names and dramatically improves the spreadsheet's searchability and professionalism.  
* **Implement Data Pruning:** To ensure the directory is accurate and does not direct clients to non-existent services, it is recommended to remove all entries listed in Table 4 (Unverifiable or Defunct Entries) of this report. An accurate, smaller list is more valuable than an exhaustive but unreliable one.  
* **Cross-Reference Key Partnerships:** The service network is highly collaborative. This reality should be reflected in the resource list. For example, in the Notes column for Isaiah 58:10, a note should state, "Operates soup kitchen at the Good Samaritan House." Conversely, the note for the Good Samaritan House should state, "Hosts the Isaiah 58:10 soup kitchen." This captures the operational reality on the ground and helps case managers understand the interconnectedness of local services.
