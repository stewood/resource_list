Resource Database Optimization and Consolidation ReportIntroductionPurpose of the ReportThis report provides a comprehensive analysis of the charity's resource database, submitted for review on August 14, 2025. The primary objective is to transform the current database into a reliable, accurate, and user-friendly tool for the organization's staff and the clients they serve. An effective resource directory is a cornerstone of efficient service delivery; it empowers case managers to make timely and appropriate referrals and enables clients to navigate the complex landscape of available support. This document outlines specific, actionable recommendations to deduplicate, correct, and enhance the records, thereby increasing the database's integrity and overall utility.MethodologyThe analysis involved a systematic, record-by-record review of the provided CSV data file.1 Each entry was scrutinized to identify instances of data redundancy, factual inaccuracies, outdated information, and logical inconsistencies. The core methodology focused on several key areas of data quality:Duplicate Identification: Locating multiple records that refer to the same organization, program, or distinct service location.Information Consolidation: Assessing the content of duplicate records to create a single, authoritative entry that synthesizes all relevant and verified information.Data Verification: Cross-referencing information within the database against details provided in the record's own verification notes and, where necessary, against established authoritative sources.Categorization and Taxonomy: Evaluating the Category and Service Types fields for accuracy and consistency to improve the database's search and filtering capabilities.Based on this analysis, all recommendations have been organized into three primary categories of action: Merging duplicate records, Archiving obsolete or invalid records, and applying Data Correction and Enhancement to salvageable but flawed records.Systemic Data Management IssuesThe review revealed that many of the data quality issues are systemic in nature, likely originating from the processes used to import and update information over time. A recurring pattern observed across numerous records is the appending of new verification notes to old ones, creating long, redundant, and difficult-to-read text blocks in the Notes field.1 For example, records for Kentucky SNAP (ID 83), Daniel Boone Community Action Agency (ID 111), and the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky (ID 357) all exhibit this issue. This practice suggests a workflow that adds information without synthesizing it, leading to data bloat and user confusion.Consequently, this report not only provides recommendations for immediate cleanup but also models a more effective approach to data management. By providing fully rewritten, consolidated descriptions and notes, the report serves as a template for future data entry, promoting a standard of clarity and conciseness that will help maintain the database's integrity long-term.Executive Summary of RecommendationsThe comprehensive audit of the resource database has yielded a clear set of actions required to significantly improve its quality and usability. The findings are summarized below, providing a high-level overview of the scope of the necessary modifications.Records Recommended for Merging: The analysis identified 7 major service providers or service types, encompassing 25 individual records, that require consolidation. These include extensive duplications for organizations like Cumberland River Behavioral Health and Volunteers of America. Merging these records will eliminate redundancy and create single, authoritative sources of information for users.Records Recommended for Archiving: A total of 7 records have been recommended for archival. These entries were found to be permanently closed, geographically irrelevant to the service area, or entirely unverifiable through the provided data and external checks. Removing them will de-clutter the database and prevent staff and clients from wasting time on non-viable resources.Records Requiring Data Correction: A significant number of records, while not duplicates, contain critical errors in categorization or service descriptions. This report highlights the most severe cases, such as a fire department miscategorized under "Mental Health," and provides corrected information to ensure the database's search and filter functions are reliable.The most critical action recommended is the systematic consolidation of the numerous records pertaining to Cumberland River Behavioral Health. This single initiative will resolve a major source of confusion and dramatically improve the user experience when searching for mental and behavioral health services. Finally, it is strongly recommended that the organization review and refine its internal data management procedures to prevent the recurrence of the systemic issues identified in this report.Part I: Records Recommended for MergingThis section details sets of records that represent the same organization or service and should be consolidated into a single, authoritative entry. For each case, a primary record is designated for retention, and a detailed plan is provided for merging information from the secondary records, which should then be archived. This process is designed to eliminate redundancy while preserving all unique and valuable data.A significant challenge within the current database is its handling of complex organizations that operate multiple programs at various physical locations. Entities like Cumberland River Behavioral Health are represented by numerous separate entries for different offices and named programs, creating a fragmented and confusing user experience. A client in need of services should not have to compare multiple records from the same parent organization to determine the correct point of contact. The recommended strategy, therefore, is to consolidate information around distinct physical service locations. Each unique address where services are offered should have one comprehensive record that details all programs available at that site.Case Study 1: Cumberland River Behavioral Health (CRBH)Problem Statement: The database contains at least eight records for Cumberland River Behavioral Health (IDs 110, 134, 142, 270, 273, 290, 322, 327, 331), creating significant confusion. This fragmentation makes it nearly impossible for a user to understand the full scope of services available at any single location or to identify the correct office for their needs.1Proposed Solution: The records will be consolidated and reorganized based on their distinct physical addresses. Programs will be described within the record for the location where they operate. This will create a clear, location-centric structure that is intuitive for users seeking services.Action 1.1: Consolidate Corbin-Based ServicesThe five records related to CRBH services in Corbin, KY, should be consolidated into distinct records for each physical address.Records to Consolidate:ID 134: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Main Office (1203 American Greeting Rd)ID 322: Appalachian Phoenix House (401 Roy Kidd Ave)ID 290: Turning Point (2932 Level Green Road)ID 273: Independence House (3110 Cumberland Falls Highway)ID 327: Capers Office (175 East Peachtree Street)Consolidation Plan:Retain ID 134 as the Primary Record for the Main Corbin Office. Update its name and description to serve as the main entry for the 1203 American Greeting Rd location.Retain Records for Other Physical Locations. Retain ID 322, ID 290, ID 273, and ID 327 as separate entries, but update them according to the plan below.Synthesize and Standardize Information for Each Location:For ID 134 (Main Office):Name: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Corbin Main OfficeDescription: Nonprofit community mental health center providing comprehensive behavioral health services. This is the main regional office for CRBH, which serves an 8-county area (Bell, Clay, Harlan, Jackson, Knox, Laurel, Rockcastle, and Whitley). Services at this location include outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment, individual, group, and family counseling, psychiatric evaluation, and medication management. A 24-hour crisis line is available at (606) 526-9552.Clean Notes Field: Remove all repetitive "VERIFIED INFORMATION" blocks and replace with a single, clean note: This is the main regional office for Cumberland River Behavioral Health. Payment is based on ability to pay. For immediate crisis support, call the 24-hour crisis line at (606) 526-9552.For ID 322 (Appalachian Phoenix House):Name: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Appalachian Phoenix HouseDescription: A 17-bed transitional housing facility operated by Cumberland River Behavioral Health. The program provides comprehensive behavioral health services, including mental health and substance abuse treatment, for residents. Services include individual and group counseling, medical and psychological support, and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT).For ID 290 (Turning Point):Name: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Turning Point Children's Crisis UnitDescription: A Children's Crisis Stabilization Unit (CCSU) providing 24/7 crisis intervention for children and adolescents ages 2-17 experiencing mental health, substance use, or suicidal crises. The program aims to prevent hospitalization or removal from the home, with a typical stay of 3-7 days.For ID 273 (Independence House):Name: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Independence HouseDescription: A residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment facility operated by Cumberland River Behavioral Health. The program provides comprehensive addiction treatment for adults, including cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, 12-step facilitation, and anger management.For ID 327 (Capers Office):Name: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Corbin Capers OfficeDescription: An outpatient services office for Cumberland River Behavioral Health. This location provides individual, group, and family counseling for mental health and substance abuse issues. Payment is based on ability to pay.Action 1.2: Standardize Data for Other CRBH OfficesThe remaining CRBH records represent distinct locations and should remain separate entries. However, their data must be standardized for clarity and consistency.Records to Standardize:ID 110: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Manchester OfficeID 142: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Barbourville OfficeID 270: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Evarts OfficeID 331: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - Williamsburg OfficeStandardization Plan:Standardize Naming Convention: Ensure all records follow the format: Cumberland River Behavioral Health - [City] Office.Complete Missing Data: Record ID 110 (Manchester Office) is missing a full street address and other key details.1 This information should be populated by referencing the official CRBH website or other verified sources.Update Descriptions: Each record's description should be updated to clearly state it is an office of CRBH, list the primary services available at that specific location, and include the 8-county service area and the central crisis line number (606) 526-9552.Clean Notes Field: As with the Corbin records, all repetitive verification blocks should be removed and replaced with a concise, standardized note.Case Study 2: VOA Recovery - Freedom HouseProblem Statement: The database contains two records for the VOA Freedom House program: ID 191 for Louisville and ID 123 for Manchester. While they are distinct locations, the information is fragmented. The Louisville record contains details about the Manchester location, while the Manchester record is sparse and missing key information like eligibility and hours.1Proposed Solution: Because these two locations operate under a single, unified program name ("Freedom House"), they should be merged into a single, comprehensive record. This will provide users with a complete overview of the program and its locations in one place.Consolidation Plan:Designate ID 191 as the Primary Record.Archive ID 123 after transferring its unique information.Rewrite Primary Record (ID 191):Name: VOA Recovery - Freedom House (Louisville & Manchester)Address: Retain the primary Louisville address: 1436 Shelby Street, Louisville, KY 40217.Phone: Retain the primary Louisville phone number: 502-635-4530.Description: Create a new, synthesized description that explains the overall program and then clearly details each location.Freedom House is a comprehensive, family-centered substance abuse treatment program for pregnant and parenting women, operated by Volunteers of America Mid-States. The program allows women to have their children (under age 18) live with them during treatment. Services include medication-assisted treatment, individual and group therapy, parenting classes, and life skills training.The program operates two primary locations:- **Louisville:** 1436 Shelby Street, Louisville, KY 40217. Phone: (502) 635-4530. A second Louisville location is at 1025 2nd Street.- **Manchester:** 8467 N Hwy 421, Manchester, KY 40962. Phone: (606) 603-2486.Eligibility Requirements: Consolidate information from both records: Women with substance use disorders who are pregnant or have children under 18. There is no limit on the number of children that can stay with their mother during treatment.Case Study 3: 988 Suicide & Crisis LifelineProblem Statement: Record ID 355 represents the general 988 Lifeline, and ID 55 details its Spanish-language services. This is an unnecessary duplication, as they are two facets of the same national service.1Proposed Solution: Merge both entries into one definitive record that clearly explains the service and its multilingual capabilities.Consolidation Plan:Designate ID 355 as the Primary Record.Archive ID 55.Rewrite Primary Record (ID 355):Name: 988 Suicide & Crisis LifelineDescription: National network of local crisis centers providing free, confidential emotional support 24/7/365 to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress. Callers are connected to trained crisis counselors who provide immediate support for suicide prevention, mental health crises, and substance use crises.Languages Available: Update this field to: English, Spanish.Notes: Add a clear, actionable note: To access services, call or text 988. For Spanish-language support, call 988 and press 2, or text AYUDA to 988. Support is also available via online chat at 988lifeline.org/chat.Case Study 4: Daniel Boone Community Action AgencyProblem Statement: Records ID 111 (Clay County Office) and ID 210 (Laurel County Office) represent two distinct physical locations of the same parent agency.1Proposed Solution: In accordance with the user's directive to keep separate locations as distinct entries, these two records should remain separate. However, they require data cleanup and standardization to improve clarity and consistency.Data Cleanup Plan (No Merging):Review and Standardize Both Records:Name: Ensure names are clear and consistent: Daniel Boone Community Action Agency - Clay County Office (ID 111) and Daniel Boone Community Action Agency - Laurel County Office (ID 210).Description: Standardize the descriptions. Each should begin by identifying the agency, list the comprehensive services offered, and state the full list of counties the parent agency serves, while clarifying the primary county served by that specific office.Clean Notes Field: Synthesize the repetitive "VERIFIED INFORMATION" blocks on both records into a single, concise note. For example, the note for ID 210 should read: This is the Laurel County office of the Daniel Boone Community Action Agency, which serves multiple counties in the region. The main office is located in Manchester, KY.Part II: Records Recommended for ArchivingThis section identifies records that are invalid, obsolete, or irrelevant to the charity's service area and should be removed from the active database. Archiving these entries is a critical step in reducing clutter and ensuring that users are only presented with viable, high-quality resources. Each recommendation includes a clear justification based on the information contained within the database.2.1 Permanently Closed or Invalid ServicesThese organizations have been confirmed as no longer operational or the provided information is invalid, making the records unusable.Record ID 326: Cedaridge MinistriesReason for Archiving: Permanently ClosedJustification: The record's Notes field contains an explicit, unambiguous statement: "PERMANENTLY CLOSED - This organization is no longer in operation." This confirmation makes the record obsolete and it should be archived to prevent erroneous referrals.1Record ID 334: Whispering PinesReason for Archiving: Invalid / UnverifiableJustification: The verification notes for this record indicate that it is likely invalid. The notes state, "This resource appears to be invalid or no longer active. The phone number does not return any search results and the name appears to be a residential property rather than an active service organization".1 Without a verifiable contact method or confirmation of services, this record is unreliable and should be removed.2.2 Unverifiable ServicesThese records could not be verified through the provided data or external checks, suggesting they may be inactive or have outdated contact information.Record ID 100: GPS - (Getting Peace for those who Served)Reason for Archiving: UnverifiableJustification: The Notes field documents a "VERIFICATION FAILED" status. It explains that comprehensive online searches using the organization's name and phone number (606) 215-1417 yielded no results. The record concludes that the organization is likely inactive or its contact information has changed.1 It should be archived until verifiable information becomes available.Record ID 79: Restoration HealthcareReason for Archiving: Invalid / No Service in AreaJustification: This record is flagged with a "CRITICAL ISSUE" in its Notes field. The verification process found that the listed website is not associated with any medical organization in Kentucky, with similar names only appearing in California and Arkansas.1 The record is invalid for the target service area and must be archived.2.3 Out-of-Area ServicesThese organizations are located outside the primary service area of Kentucky and do not provide direct, local services to the target population.Record ID 8: Valiant Recovery FloridaReason for Archiving: Service Outside Geographic AreaJustification: The record is for a substance abuse treatment center located in Punta Gorda, Florida. The Notes field explicitly confirms, "This organization is located in Florida and serves Charlotte County, Florida residents. It is NOT local to Kentucky and should be archived".1Record ID 309: Summit at Harmony OaksReason for Archiving: Service Outside Geographic AreaJustification: The physical address for this addiction treatment center is in Newport, Tennessee.1 While some individuals may travel for services, the database should prioritize local and regional resources. This out-of-state facility should be archived.Record ID 36: Food for the PoorReason for Archiving: Service Outside Geographic Area / Irrelevant Service ModelJustification: This is a large international aid organization based in Florida that focuses on providing relief in Latin America and the Caribbean.1 It is not a direct service provider for the local homeless population in Kentucky and is therefore not relevant to the database's purpose.Part III: Records Requiring Data Correction and EnhancementThis section identifies records that, while valuable, contain significant errors in categorization, service descriptions, or other key fields. Correcting these inaccuracies is essential for the database's functionality, particularly for search and filtering features. Implementing a standardized taxonomy for service types will further enhance data consistency and user experience.Proposed Standardized TaxonomyTo ensure future data integrity and improve searchability, it is recommended that a controlled vocabulary be adopted for the Category and Service Types fields. This prevents ambiguity and ensures that users can reliably filter for the services they need.Category (Select One)Associated Service Types (Select all that apply)Food & NutritionFood Pantry, Soup Kitchen, SNAP/WIC EnrollmentHousing & ShelterEmergency Shelter, Transitional Housing, Public Housing, Housing Authority, Rent/Utility AssistanceHealthcareMedical Care, Dental Care, Women's Health, Children's Health, Vision Care, Prescription AssistanceMental & Behavioral HealthMental Health Counseling, Substance Abuse Treatment, Crisis Intervention, Support Groups, Peer SupportLegal & FinancialLegal Aid, Financial Assistance, Credit Counseling, Benefits AssistanceEmployment & EducationJob Training, Employment Services, GED/Adult EducationFamily & Community SupportChild Care, Domestic Violence Services, Veterans Services, Senior Services, LGBTQ+ SupportEmergency & Public SafetyEmergency Services, Fire Department, Law Enforcement, Hotline3.1 Critical Category and Service Type CorrectionsThe following records contain severe miscategorizations that fundamentally misrepresent the services offered. These errors must be corrected to ensure the database is reliable.Record ID 282: Lily Fire & RescueCurrent Category: Mental HealthCurrent Service Types: Substance Abuse TreatmentAnalysis: This record is for a volunteer fire department providing emergency medical and rescue services.1 The current categorization is incorrect and misleading.Correction:Change Category to Emergency & Public Safety.Remove the incorrect Service Types. Add a new Service Types tag: Emergency Services.Update Populations Served to All residents and visitors in the Lily, KY service area.Record ID 121: New Hope Counseling and RecoveryCurrent Service Types: "Counseling, Food Assistance, Food Pantry, Housing, Mental Health Counseling, Substance Abuse, Substance Abuse Treatment, Transportation"Analysis: The Notes field for this record contains a critical warning: "This organization does NOT provide housing, transitional housing, domestic violence services, medical care, or transportation services. Their services are strictly outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment".1 The current service tags are dangerously inaccurate.Correction:Remove all incorrect Service Types.Retain only the accurate tags: Mental Health Counseling and Substance Abuse Treatment.Record ID 350: Saint William Catholic ChurchCurrent Service Types: "Healthcare, Mental Health Counseling"Analysis: The verification notes clearly state, "This is a Catholic church providing religious services, not a food pantry or medical care facility".1 The assigned service types are incorrect.Correction:Change Category to Family & Community Support.Remove the incorrect Service Types. A tag like Spiritual Support could be added if the taxonomy is expanded.Record ID 319: Life Abundant Ministries and Healing RoomsCurrent Category: Food AssistanceAnalysis: The Notes field explicitly clarifies, "NOT a food pantry - this organization provides spiritual healing services only".1 The primary category is wrong.Correction:Change Category to Mental & Behavioral Health.Change Service Types to Spiritual Support or Support Groups.3.2 Description and Notes Field CleanupMany records suffer from cluttered and repetitive Notes fields due to an additive update process. This information should be synthesized into a single, coherent paragraph that is easy for users to read.Record ID 83: Kentucky SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program)Problem: The Notes field contains three large, redundant blocks of verification text, making it difficult to extract key contact information.1Correction: The Notes field should be rewritten to be concise and actionable.Rewritten Notes Example: Program administered by the Kentucky Department for Community Based Services (DCBS). Applications can be made online at kynect.ky.gov. Key Contact Numbers: Toll-free SNAP hotline: (855) 306-8959; TTY: (800) 627-4720; EBT card replacement: (888) 979-9949. A directory of local DCBS offices is available on the CHFS website.Record ID 357: Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky (HHCK)Problem: Similar to the SNAP record, the Notes field is filled with multiple, repetitive "VERIFIED INFORMATION" and "MERGED INFO" blocks, obscuring the essential details of the organization.1Correction: Consolidate the notes into a single, informative paragraph.Rewritten Notes Example: HHCK is a statewide coalition that advocates for affordable housing and works to end homelessness. The organization provides coordinated entry for housing assistance and supports member organizations across 118 counties in Kentucky (all except Fayette and Jefferson). Key programs include permanent supportive housing vouchers for chronically homeless individuals and families.Appendix: Comprehensive Action ChecklistThis table provides a complete, record-by-record checklist of all recommended actions.
