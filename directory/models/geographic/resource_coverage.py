    """Through model for Resource-CoverageArea relationship with audit trail.

    This model manages the many-to-many relationship between Resources and
    CoverageAreas while providing a complete audit trail of when associations
    were created, by whom, and any additional metadata.

    The through model allows for:
    - Audit trail of all resource-coverage area associations
    - Tracking who created each association
    - Additional metadata about the association
    - Proper cleanup when resources or coverage areas are deleted

    Attributes:
        resource: The resource being associated
        coverage_area: The coverage area being associated
        created_by: User who created the association
        created_at: When the association was created

    Example:
        >>> # Associate a resource with a coverage area
        >>> association = ResourceCoverage.objects.create(
        ...     resource=crisis_center,
        ...     coverage_area=laurel_county,
        ...     created_by=admin_user
        ... )

        >>> # Get all coverage areas for a resource
        >>> resource.coverage_areas.all()

        >>> # Get all resources in a coverage area
        >>> coverage_area.resources.all()
